# API Freeze V1

## Status: FROZEN
## Version: 1.0
## Date: 2026-06-05

## Accepted Risks
* RLS policies and RPCs place a heavy computation load on the database.
* Express REST API calls mean the database schema is closely tied to the frontend data models.

## Known Limitations
* Rate limiting is currently global per IP/User; advanced behavioral rate limiting is not implemented.

## Future Improvements
* Advanced cursor pagination with filtered aggregates.
* PostgreSQL-level query caching via `pg_stat_statements` tuning for public event feeds.

> **Historical Architecture Reference**: Earlier versions mentioned GraphQL (via pg_graphql) and Redis as future improvements. These were evaluated and rejected — the approved stack uses REST exclusively and relies on PostgreSQL query optimization rather than external caching layers.

## Not In Scope
* Cryptographic signing of API requests from the mobile client.

## Resolved Issues (Phase 1-4)
* All 11 missing RPCs (disputes, handovers, lock/unlock, etc.) have been added to the catalog.
* Event archiving access has been expanded to include Faculty roles.

## Resolved Issues (Post-Audit Freeze Pass — 2026-06-09)
* `register_event` RPC now explicitly documents `SELECT FOR UPDATE` pattern with `max_capacity` and `registration_count` fields.
* `approve_leadership_transfer` and `reject_leadership_transfer` RPCs now include `FACULTY_ADMIN` as a fallback caller.
* Audit trigger actor identity resolution documented: triggers use `current_user_id()` from `app.user_id` session variable.
